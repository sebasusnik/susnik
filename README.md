# Portfolio Terminal

This is a personal portfolio reimagined as an interactive, draggable terminal window. Built with Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS, it offers a unique way to explore my projects, skills, and contact information through a command-line interface.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Terminal UI**: A familiar command-line interface for navigating the portfolio.
- **Draggable & Resizable Window**: The terminal can be moved and resized like a native application window, thanks to `react-draggable` and `re-resizable`.
- **macOS-like Controls**: Classic red, yellow, and green window buttons for an authentic feel.
- **Command-Based Navigation**: Use simple, intuitive commands to explore different sections.
- **Command History**: Cycle through previously entered commands using the up and down arrow keys.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts smoothly to various screen sizes.
